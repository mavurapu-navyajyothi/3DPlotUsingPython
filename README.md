# 3DPlotUsingPython
Using python Matplotlib we try constructing the 3d axis ie, x-axis, y-axis, z-axis.
Then we use a contour plot where we use function with using x and y values.
usually we have x and y value labelled if we some sample data.
But in real life they are not know so we use Surface Triangulation.
